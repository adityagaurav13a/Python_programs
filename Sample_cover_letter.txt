Hiring Manager
{Company_Name}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the {Job_title} position at {Company_Name}, as advertised. With over 3+ years of experience as a Quality Assurance and Test Automation Engineer at Capgemini, I bring a strong foundation in test strategy, automation, and system validation, particularly within complex network and optical domains such as Cisco‚Äôs NCS product line (1004, 1010, 1014).

Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered high-impact testing solutions by blending automation frameworks (Python, Pytest, CAFY) with robust manual strategies across functional, regression, and system-level domains. My recent initiatives‚Äîsuch as reducing image bring-up times by 80%, leading large-scale framework migrations, and driving CI-integrated memory leak detection‚Äîdemonstrate my commitment to both quality and innovation. I‚Äôve also served briefly as Scrum Master, driving agile ceremonies and aligning QA with delivery roadmaps.

Beyond my technical contributions, I‚Äôve collaborated with cross-functional teams, interacted directly with customers to troubleshoot issues, and earned internal recognition including the ‚ÄúAutomation Champion ‚Äì 2025‚Äù award. My certifications in Git, Linux, networking, and Python further enhance my readiness for dynamic, engineering-focused environments.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my expertise in automation and infrastructure QA to [Company Name], and to continue growing within a forward-thinking team. I welcome the chance to discuss how I can bring value to your organization and support your quality goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of an interview.

Warm regards,
Aditya Gaurav
